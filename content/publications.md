  **Abstract**—Developers often collaborate to fix complex bugs,
even in open source software systems (OSS) where collaboration
largely occurs through discussions in the bug tracker. The implicit
Developer Social Networks (DSN) are created as a result of
these discussions. Past research has investigated the usefulness of
such DSNs in addressing many Software Engineering problems
(e.g. Defect Prediction, Evolution of collaboration patterns, etc.).
However, the multifaceted nature of DSNs constructed from
bug reports data has been ignored in most of the past studies.
That is, in most of the past studies, the link among developers
exist only if they comment on the same bug report while in
reality, the developers may be connected indirectly (e.g. pair
of developers are connected even if they comment on two
different bug reports which are associated with the same software
component). Such unexplored relationships among developers
can be used in defining new measures to identify important
developers in the OSS system which otherwise is not trivial to
do. In this paper, we study this implicit multifaceted nature
of collaborations among developers by extending single layer
DSN to Multi-layer DSN (MDSN). Our experiments performed
on bug data of Eclipse and NetBeans show that structure of
DSNs and their evolution at various layers differ significantly
and performance of developers in bug fixing process is not only
significantly correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient up to 0.74)
with their network centrality scores but also vary across various
layers of MDSN signifying their usefulness in determining the
crucial and important developers in the software systems.
